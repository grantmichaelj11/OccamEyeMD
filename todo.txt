[x] Create a simulation enviroment
	-> Read an xyz file
[x] Look into python wrappers?
	-> pybind11 looks promising and 'easy' to use
	-> Write a function -> create a python binding for it
		-> We can run everything in python!
[x] GOAL: Write a function that reads in atoms and coordinates from an xyz file and call it in Python

[x] Redefine the class that loads in external files
	-> I want to be able to select what type of file gets read (PDB, xyz, other types?)
	-> Add functionality for typical MD
[x] Determine how I want to visualize the simulations
	-> Novel approach
	-> VMD trajectories
	-> OVITO
	-> VESTA
[x] Find FF parameters for GAFF
